For the time being it seems I've hit a stop on december 9th and 10th. I have ideas on how to solve both but...

# December 12

I am masively disapointed in this star :|. Before coding I made a sanity check to see how many shapes where under/equal/over the given area. I found about half where bellow. I was ready to start coding a few days later when I thought I should make sure the answer wasn't simply every area where it theoreticaly could fit... but it was.
